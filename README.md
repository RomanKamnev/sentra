## ðŸ§± Architecture

Sentra Core is built around modular, cloud-native components:

- **Ingestion** â€” Kafka producers / log emitters
- **Stream Processing** â€” Flink jobs for windowed aggregation, filtering, and scoring
- **Rule Engine** â€” YAML/JSON-based detection logic
- **ML Layer** â€” Baseline anomaly detection (e.g. Isolation Forest)
- **Infra** â€” Docker Compose, K8s manifests, Terraform
- **ChatOps / API** â€” Alert API stubs, future Slack/Telegram integrations
