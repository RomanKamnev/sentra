# Sentra Core

üìú Licensed under **BUSL-1.1** ‚Äî commercial use requires a license. Apache 2.0 from 2028.

üöÄ **Sentra** is an open-core, real-time AI-driven SIEM platform combining rule-based detection, machine learning anomaly detection, and behavior-driven Eventless AI analytics ‚Äî built with Apache Flink, Kafka, Python, and Qdrant.

This repository contains the **open-source core** of the platform, including stream processing, detection logic, eventless behavior analysis, and baseline infrastructure.

---

## üß± Architecture

Sentra Core is structured into modular, cloud-native components:

- **Ingestion** ‚Äî Kafka producers / log emitters
- **Stream Processing** ‚Äî Flink jobs for windowed aggregation, rule evaluation, ML scoring, and snapshot aggregation
- **Rule Engine** ‚Äî YAML/JSON-based detection logic (thresholds, event patterns)
- **ML Layer** ‚Äî Baseline anomaly detection (Speed/Geo Anomalies)
- **Eventless AI Layer** ‚Äî Behavior embedding generation + anomaly detection using Qdrant
- **LLM Agent** ‚Äî Summarization, Threat Recommendation, Severity Classification, Confirmable Actions
- **Infra** ‚Äî Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform automation
- **ChatOps / API** ‚Äî Alert API stubs, Confirmable Actions portal integration (future Slack/Telegram connectors)
- **Monitoring & Observability** ‚Äî Prometheus, Grafana, LLM latency tracing, embedding drift monitoring

## üìä Detection Strategies

| Detection Layer          | Focus                                          | Examples                                                                             |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rule Engine**          | Known threats, predefined conditions           | SSH brute force (5+ failed logins), logins from new IPs/devices                      |
| **ML Anomaly Detection** | Simple behavioral anomalies                    | Speed anomaly (too many events too quickly), Geo anomaly (improbable location jumps) |
| **Eventless AI**         | Emerging/unknown threats, behavioral deviation | Unusual session patterns, stealthy lateral movement, subtle behavioral drift         |

Sentra uses a layered detection model where **Rules + ML + Eventless AI** work together to maximize detection coverage while minimizing false positives.
